# HintAI

**AI-powered coding assistant that provides real-time Socratic hints for algorithm problems**

ðŸš§ **Work in Progress** - Building in public!

## What is HintAI?

HintAI analyzes your code as you write it and provides contextual hints to guide your thinking - without revealing the solution. Unlike static hints (like LeetCode Premium), HintAI:

- âœ… Analyzes YOUR actual code in real-time
- âœ… Detects algorithm patterns (two-pointer, DP, sliding window)
- âœ… Generates personalized Socratic questions
- âœ… Learns from 1,000+ solution patterns
- âœ… Works on any coding platform (Chrome extension)

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL (pgvector), Redis
- **RAG System:** Sentence-Transformers for embeddings, semantic search
- **Code Analysis:** AST parsing for pattern detection
- **Frontend:** Chrome extension with WebSocket streaming
- **Testing:** Pytest with comprehensive coverage

## Architecture

```
User writes code â†’ Chrome extension captures â†’ WebSocket â†’ FastAPI backend
                                                              â†“
                                            AST Parser detects patterns
                                                              â†“
                                            RAG retrieves similar solutions
                                                              â†“
                                            Generate Socratic hint
                                                              â†“
                                            Return to user
