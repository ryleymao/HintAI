# Extension Icons

For now, you can create simple icons using any design tool, or use emoji-based icons.

To create proper icons:

1. **Use a design tool** (Figma, Canva, etc.)
2. **Create 3 sizes:** 16x16, 48x48, 128x128 pixels
3. **Design:** Light bulb icon with "AI" text
4. **Format:** PNG with transparent background

## Quick Option: Generate from Emoji

You can use the ðŸ’¡ emoji as a temporary icon by:
1. Taking a screenshot of the emoji
2. Resizing to 16x16, 48x48, 128x128
3. Saving as PNG files

## Files needed:
- `icon16.png` - For extension toolbar
- `icon48.png` - For extension management
- `icon128.png` - For Chrome Web Store

For now, the extension will work without icons (Chrome will show a default placeholder).
